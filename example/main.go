/*
Package inj/example is a demonstration the inj package. It takes the form of a very simple web application
that is modelled by a struct. Depdendencies for the application are defined on struct fields using tags,
and provided in the main function. On startup, the application will provide and check its dependencies,
then start a simple HTTP server with two endpoints.

The functions for the endpoints use a rudimentary HTTP middleware wrapped so they can make use of inj.Inject,
and thus have non-standard argument requirements. That will make sense when you see it in action.

Hopefully the code is reasonably self-explanatory. To experience the full utility of inj, compare main.go to
main_test.go.

This is the struct that describes the application. The struct has one function (`run()`, which you'll see below)
and three fields that represent things it will need for the demo. None of the fields will be populates explicitly:
rather, they will be provided using dependency injection.

As you can probably see, depdendency requirements are indicated using an `inj:""` struct tag. Fields with this tag
will be assigned, if possible, during the provision call; fields without the tag will be ignored.

There are currently no values to pass in the struct tag. Future versions may make more use of them, but for the
moment all tags must pass strings in double quotes to satisfy Go's reflect.StructTag parsing.

It should be noted that any field can be associatd with the tag. The field doesn't have to be a special type, and
there are no limits (aside from the constraints of the language itself) as to what they can be.

`Application`'s functions (there are three) are at the end of this file.

// A coda: middleware and `inj.Inject()`
/////////////////////////////////////////////

/*
This application uses `http.HandleFunc` to, well, handle HTTP requests using a function. That's because I needed to find a
vaguely realistic way of demonstrating the third and last API function, `inj.Inject()`. As it turns out, it's quite a nice
use of the `inj` API, but I realise you might not use this in your own applications.

`inj.Inject()` is a variadic function that requires a function (any kind of function) as its first argument, and then zero
or more other objects as it variadic component. Under the hood, it examines the arguments of the function, tries to find
values for each one from the graph (or, if they're not available in the graph, the variadic arguments to inj.Inject()`
itself) and then calls the function.

This can be a little bit confusing to think about to begin with, and HTTP middleware (which is typically a function that
returns a function) doesn't necessarily clear things up. It might be easier to visualise it like this:

	inj.Provide("This string value is in the graph")
	inj.Inject(
		func(s string, i int) {
			fmt.Sprintf("String value: %s, int value: %d", s, i)
		},
		10 // This is an int value
	)

The code above inserts a string value into the graph and then `inj.Inject()` to call a function. The function is called
immediately, and prints some text to stdout: "String value: This string value is in the graph, int value: 10".

The values come from the graph, and the variadic arguments to `inj.Inject()`. They're specified by the arguments to function
itself. When `inj.Inject()` is called, it examines the each argument in turn and checks if it has a value for it. Because
there's a string in the graph, the string argument is injectable; because there's an integer in the call to `inj.Inject()`
the integer agument is injectable. The order of the arguments doesn't matter. If an argument is not available, then a runtime
panic will be thrown.

It's not just for callback functions. Closures in Go mean that you can chuck in a call to `inj.Inject()` anywhere, and pull
objects from the graph. Imagine you have an instance of a database accessor in your graph:

	inj.Provide(databaseStruct{})

Now say you have some business logic function that needs access to the database accessor, but it has no way to directly find it.
You can use a simple nested closure with `inj.Inject()` to assemble all the values you need:

	func (b *SomeBusinessLogicController) DoSomethingImportant(ctx *business.Context, p *ptrToThing) {
		inj.Inject(func(db DatatabaseInterface) {
			// Now `ctx`, `p` AND `db` are all in scope, and you didn't have to change the arguments to your function
		})
	}

I don't want to brag, but that's pretty nifty, right?

Getting back to the demo, the  `middleware()` function returns another function that makes use of `inj.Inject()`.
Everything in the graph will be available to the the `fn` function, as well as the `http.ResponseWriter` and `*http.Request`
arguments that are passed by the http package. You'll see implementations for the handle functions at the end of this file,
and you'll notice that they can specify any arguments they like, not just the standard ones you'd expect. This is the really
nifty part of the `inj` package: callback functions can decide which variables they want dynamically.

This callback is wrapped by `inj.Inject()`, so it can specify whatever arguments it wants. Here, we're requesting the

real-world sense. The function illustrates that you can omit normally-required functions and add others, and that's all

/*
That's pretty much it! To recap:

- There are three API functions in the `inj` package: `inj.Provide()`, `inj.Assert()` and `inj.Inject()`.
- Use `inj.Provide()` any number of times to initially wire up your graph
- Then use `inj.Assert()` to make sure all the dependencies were met.
- If you want to use dynamic function values, use `inj.Inject()`, which can also accept local arguments.

Do check out main_test.go, which demonstrates how to use `inj` for testing.
